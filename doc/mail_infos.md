Dear Mr. Rascoussier,

Regarding your questions,

0. At Uni Passau, I will be supervising you directly and Prof. Dr. Granitzer will oversee the direction of the
   thesis.
1. We expect a good understanding of software programming principles and logic. We also expect good knowledge of python coding along with different machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pytorch.
2. There will not be any requirement to modify the Linux kernel.
3. We already published a dataset of heaps and you can take a look at the method and dataset [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.05243.pdf).
4. Memory2Vec is one of the methods under consideration to create an embedding for structures in raw memory. Different preprocessing methods might be required.
5. We already have a pipeline for extracting data. Acquisition of data is not an issue. A smaller dataset of
   heap dumps is available on Zenodo.
6. We are collaborating with the Chair of Reliable Distributed Systems of Prof. Dr. Reiser and we work only
   on the machine learning aspect of the project.

   This is part of a collaboration between the Chair of Reliable Distributed Systems and the Chair of
   Data Science. We focus only on the machine learning part of the collaboration. Data acquisition and other security-related features are implemented by my colleagues at the Chair of Reliable Distributed Systems.

   I hope that I have answered your questions. Let me know if you have any further questions.

   Best regards,

   Christofer Fellicious
